  <meta name="description" content="IPDK, or Infrastructure Programmer Development Kit, is an open source, vendor-agnostic framework of drivers and APIs for infrastructure offload and management that runs on a CPU or an IPU.  IPDK runs in Linux and uses a set of well-established tools such as SPDK, DPDK, Quick Assist and P4 to enable network virtualization, storage virtualization, workload provisioning, root-of-trust and offload capabilities found in the platform.  The components within IPDK, already optimized for Xeon servers, provide a common platform across CPUs and IPUs for increasing performance, optimizing resources and securing the infrastructure with an open-source eco-system.

      <td>DPUs are starting to become mainstream devices in Edge, Cloud, and Data Center environments and unlike the previous generation of accelerators and SmartNICs, DPUs present an opportunity to rethink the traditional deployment architectures.  Multiple vendors are developing a variety of interfaces and frameworks that are highly platform dependent, resulting in the potential for complex and isolated deployments.  Discover the need for a common interface framework for the DPU ecosystem and how a vendor agnostic approach, built on existing industry APIs and new API definitions, simplifies the creation of DPU based solutions.</td>

      <td>Infrastructure Programmer Development Kit (IPDK) is an open source, vendor agnostic framework of drivers and APIs for infrastructure offload and management that runs on a CPU, IPU, DPU or switch.  IPDK’s role in a broader open eco-system is meant to be an open-source development effort for finding common APIs across devices and components within the infrastructure, as well as finding common control plane frameworks for orchestration.  In this talk we’ll give an update as to where we are in this effort, where we are going and how we want to integrate the direction and governance of IPDK under the umbrella of Open Programmable Infrastructure.</td>

      <td>AI/ML driven insights can accelerate the digital transformation of the enterprise. MLOps manages the lifecycle of AI/ML at a higher level e.g., workflows for model training, serving, tuning etc. and is typically unaware of the infrastructure layers in a multi-cloud world. How can we consistently execute such workflows on programmable and accelerated infrastructure? In this talk, we show how MLOps workflows can be specified on top of Kubernetes and discuss performance optimization of the same. In addition, we discuss new directions in machine learning that could benefit from such programmable infrastructure.</td>

Learn to define what a DPU is, how it can be used to separate infrastructure services from application workloads, and why this is so important.

An organization needs to gain the immediate insights of the ever-growing data estates, protect its assets from cyberattack and enable developers to develop solutions more efficiently and globally. The traditional infrastructure can no longer satisfy the new requirements. We need a new intelligent infrastructure that is more elastic, more secure, and more efficient. Developers can now leverage DPU/IPU/SmartNic technology to modernize its infrastructure – compute, network and storage. In this session, IBM will present its vision of infrastructure evolution and the possible applications and services that can take advantage of this technology.</td>
